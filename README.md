## Task 03: Cats and Dogs classification (SVM)

## Overview
This task involves implement a support vector machine (SVM).

The objective of this task is to create (SVM) to classify iamges of cats and dogs.

## ðŸ’¡ The benefit of this project:

âœ… Practical application on Machine Learning using SVM.
âœ… Learn image processing using OpenCV.
âœ… Learn how to deal with image data and convert it into numerical features.
âœ… Experiment with the SVM algorithm and see how it performs in image classification
